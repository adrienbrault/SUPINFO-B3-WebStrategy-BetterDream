Better Dream
============

You can see this app running live at [http://betterdream.org](http://betterdream.org).

At [SUPINFO](http://www.supinfo.com), during the 3rd year, we had a course about **SEO** (named WebStrategy).
At the end, we were all given a subject (Here, it was ```Better Dream```), and we had to create a website and use the various techniques we saw during the course to be well ranked on google or bing/etc (SEO!).

Here is my take, using **Symfony 2.1**. The website is internationalized in English and French.
This project is mostly about internationalization, assets optimization/performances, and content.
Aside the symfony standard edition, i used the following bundles:

* [mopa/bootstrap-bundle](http://packagist.org/packages/mopa/bootstrap-bundle) For the design
* [knplabs/knp-menu-bundle](http://packagist.org/packages/knplabs/knp-menu-bundle) For the top menu (mopa bootstrap uses this)
* [jms/i18n-routing-bundle](http://packagist.org/packages/jms/i18n-routing-bundle) To internationalize URLS

The code is **MIT** licensed.

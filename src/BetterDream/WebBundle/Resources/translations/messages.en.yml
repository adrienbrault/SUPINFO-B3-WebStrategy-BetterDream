            Sleep is a <strong>very important</strong> step in the life of every human being.<br>
            By losing awareness, you allow your subconscious to repair the mistakes you made during the day.
            Theses mistakes were generally made unwillingly.
            <br>
            <br>
            You must be astonished to read that your sleep fixes your mistakes, but read on the following examples to understand why:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you relive a moment in your head, knowing that you should have said something else and
                    trying to find what you should have said, your sleep and dreams have a chance to show you
                    that you were close of success.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>It is best to sleep on it</strong> is a famous sentence, that demonstrates very well that
                    dreams let us increase and fulfil our ideas! Having better dreams helps you solve harder
                    problems at night, because you can choose to dream about mathematics instead of unicorns or cats!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have you ever been woken up suddently because of a bad nightmare ? Avoid nightmares, and
                    have a better dreams instead, is a simple solution, trick, to help your sleep better.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            Sleeping better and having better dreams is a substantial help to your health.
            <br>
            How do you think these billionaires have found their successful ideas, and solve all their problems, while working
            hard ? They've just dug in their dreams to solve problems, and also sometimes to forget everything during restful
            nights.
